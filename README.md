## :construction_worker: How to Run

### Requirements

The library is written in language C and thus needs the **`cc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Including header**
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

**2. Compiling**

Make sure that you have your own `main` before.

To compile with `get_next_line`, run:

```shell
$ cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c <your .c files>
```
